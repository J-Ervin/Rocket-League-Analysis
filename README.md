# Rocket-League-Analysis
A project that uses technical analysis to analyze key components between teams that play Rocket League at the professional level.
The project uses many analysis techniques:
Win-Loss Stat Comparison to gather knowledge on what stats are higher for winning teams, indicating that some stats should be focused on more to increase win rate.
T-Test Analysis which shows which stats are significant when it comes to winning and losing.
Pairwise Correlation Analysis to determine what stats affect other stats. This was used to try and find underlying important stats that would be overlooked in the Win-Loss Stat Comparison.
Correlation Analysis separating stats into wins and loss categories to gather more information on important stats that correlate to winning and losing.
K-Means Cluster Analysis that separates certain matches into aggressive, passive, and both aggressive and passive playstyles. This test was used to see if certain playstyles increased win rates.
Logistic Regression Analysis with a logistic regression model used to predict match outcomes from a training dataset. The model gave insights to what stats it believes are crucial to winning matches.
